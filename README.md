The project uses scikit-learn to create machine learning models which perform analysis on the Iris dataset starting from Q7 through Decision Tree classifiers trained at tree depths 1, 2, and 3 which demonstrate underfitting and overfitting through their training and test accuracy results. Q8 demonstrates how decision boundaries change when KNeighborsClassifier uses sepal dimensions with different neighbor counts starting from 1 up to 10 because local noise competes against global generalization. The Q9 evaluation of our $k=5$ model generates a detailed performance report which includes a confusion matrix, precision-recall metrics from the classification report, and a multi-class ROC curve to measure Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each species.
